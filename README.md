Let's dive into the code for image captioning using PaliGemma. We will go through each step, from installation to generating captions, to help you get started.

1. Install Required Libraries
First, we need to install the necessary libraries to access the PaliGemma model. Specifically, we'll use the keras-nlp library:

2. Import Libraries
Next, we import the libraries that will be used throughout the code:

3. Set Up Kaggle Credentials
Here, I retrieve the Kaggle credentials from the environment. Make sure to store your Kaggle username and API key in the Colab secret keys for secure access:

4. Load the PaliGemma Model
Now, we load the PaliGemma model. I'm using the pali_gemma_3b_mix_448 preset, which is a pre-trained checkpoint optimized for images with a resolution of 448x448 pixels:

5. Display Model Summary
We can now display a summary of the loaded model to understand its structure and parameters:

6. Load and Prepare the Image
To process an image, we first load it using Keras's load_img function, which also allows resizing to the required dimensions. Then, we convert the image to a NumPy array:

7. Convert Image to Tensor
Next, we transform the NumPy array into a Tensor object using TensorFlow's convert_to_tensor function, making it ready for the PaliGemma model:

8. Display the Image
Before passing the image to PaliGemma, let's display it to see what we're working with. Here's the image we'll use (for example, a cow):

9. Generate an Image Caption
Now, we use PaliGemma to generate a caption. Start by defining a prompt, such as "Caption the image in detail." Then, pass both the image and the prompt to the generate() function:
